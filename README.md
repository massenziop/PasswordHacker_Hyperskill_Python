# Password Hacker with Python.
## Project description
All sorts of creatures lurk around the Internet, including trolls, pirates, miners – and hackers. In this project, 
you're going to step into the shoes of a hacker, tasked with infiltrating a secret server — password unknown. Your 
mission is to create a Python program that can crack the password swiftly. Learn how hacking works and create a complex
application where you will work on iterators and generators, itertools and time module. You will practice concepts
frequently tested in technical interviews at top tech companies.

## Content

- **Stage 1/5.**
  For starters, let’s pretend the admin's website isn't protected at all. Learn how to connect to the server and receive
data from it to access private information.
- **Stage 2/5.**
  OK, the admin has pumped up the server and it is now password-protected. But the password is probably short. Let's
hack it by applying brute force (and no, that does not mean taking a jackhammer to the physical server!).
- **Stage 3/5.**
  The admin has picked up on our attempts to access the server, so now it is protected with a more complex password.
Maybe the password is long but not unique? Let's hack it using a dictionary of the most common passwords!
- **Stage 4/5.**
  The admin is really taking the case seriously. Now it is necessary to specify a valid login and password, and the
password cannot be cracked by brute force. And yet, there is a vulnerability in the system that you can exploit to
identify the admin's login and password.
- **Stage 5/5.** 
  The admin has reacted quickly and made a patch that removes the vulnerability. It's time to look for another one.
Poor admin…
  
## Assignment

### Stage 1/5: 
##### Description
Imagine some admin who runs a website on the Internet. The site is becoming very popular, and a lot of people register.
Filling in their profiles, they leave some information there that is not meant to be public, for example, information
about their credit cards.

The admin completely forgot about the security of the site, so now you can log in with admin privileges without even
having a login and password!

> Terms like "hacking" and "hacker" are frequently associated with negativity. However, in this project, we will be
operating as White Hats. Throughout all stages, simulated scenarios will be employed. Remember, any skills and knowledge
acquired during this project should be used exclusively for ethical and educational purposes. Still, it is possible that
publishing your work on this project may be viewed ambiguously by platforms or employers. We recommend caution to avoid
being flagged or banned.

The first task of this project is to go to the admin's site; it will immediately give out all the secret information.
Remember, as soon as you enter the site as an admin, you will automatically obtain all the private data of the site.
It will get harder: the tasks of all other stages of the project will be to crack the admin password. Good luck!

Your program should connect to the server using an IP address and a port from the command line arguments. You can use
socket module to create this program.

##### Objectives
Your program will receive command line arguments in this order:

1. IP address
2. port
3. message for sending

The algorithm is the following:

1. Create a new socket.
2. Connect to a host and a port using the socket.
3. Send a message from the third command line argument to the host using the socket.
4. Receive the server’s response.
5. Print the server’s response.
6. Close the socket.

##### Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

**Example 1:**
```terminaloutput
> python hack.py localhost 9090 password
Wrong password!
Example 2:
```
**Example 2:**
```terminaloutput
> python hack.py 127.0.0.1 9090 qwerty
Connection Success!
```

### Stage 2/5: 
##### Description

The admin noticed someone sneaking around the site with admin rights and came up with a password. Now to log in as an admin, you need to enter the password first. Maybe the admin has set a relatively easy and short password so that it is easy to remember? Let's try to brute force all possible passwords to enter the site!

So far the program is very simplistic: it’s time to improve it so that it can generate different variants of the password and then try each one. The admin of the server doesn’t hide the information that passwords vary in length and may include letters from `a` to `z` and numbers from `0` to `9`. You should start with `a,b,c,....,z,0,1,..aa,ab,ac,ad` and continue until your password is correct. The `itertools.product()` function can help you here. It’s very important to try all the variants of every length because otherwise your program risks never finding the password!

If the password is correct, you will receive the `Connection success!` message from the server. Otherwise, you will receive the `Wrong password!` message. The server itself cannot receive more than a million attempts, so if your program works indefinitely, you will see the unfortunate message `Too many attempts`.

##### Objectives

In this stage, you should write a program that:

1. Parses the command line and gets two arguments that are IP address and port.
2. Tries different passwords until it finds the correct one.
3. Prints the password it found.

> **Note:** You only have to connect to the server once and then send messages multiple times. Don't reconnect to the server before sending every message. However, each message needs to be encoded before sending and decoded after receiving from the server.

Also, keep in mind that here and throughout the project, the password is randomly generated every time you check your code.

##### Example

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

```terminaloutput
> python hack.py localhost 9090
pass
```

### Stage 3/5
##### Description

Looks like you can already call yourself a hacker! However, the situation gets more complicated: the admin improves the server and our simple brute force attack is no longer working. Well, this shouldn't hold you back: you can provide your program with a prepared [dictionary of typical passwords](https://cogniterra.org/media/attachments/lesson/24447/passwords.txt) (it was generated using a [database with over a million real-life passwords](https://www.troyhunt.com/the-773-million-record-collection-1-data-reach/)).

That's not all: the admin decided to outsmart us and changed the case of some letters in the new password so that we could not crack it using the password dictionary. Let's outsmart the admin and try all possible combinations of upper and lower case for each letter for all words of the password dictionary. We won't have to try too much since for a 6-letter word you'll get only 64 possible combinations.

Now not only do you have to try each element of the dictionary but you also need to change the case of some letters to find the correct password. And when you've entered the correct password, the server will greet you with `"Connection success!"`.

This has increased the time of hacking greatly, so using brute force is probably not an option. Use the dictionary of standard passwords, and do not forget to try changing the cases of different letters. For example, there is the word ‘qwerty’ in the dictionary, but the cunning admin sets it to ‘qWeRTy’. Your program should make it possible to hack such passwords, too.

##### Objectives

In this stage, you should write a program that:

1. Parses the command line and gets two arguments that are IP address and port.
2. Finds the correct password using the list of typical passwords.
3. Prints the password it found.

While trying to figure out the password you can try using the `zip()` function to pair up upper and lower case letters and `*` to unpack lists to be used as argument to `itertools.product()`.

> **Note:** Put the file with typical passwords into your working directory which you can find with a little help of the `os` module or you may use absolute paths for certainty. And don't forget to log the operations of your program for easier debugging.

> **Note:** To avoid **ConnectionResetError** and **ConnectionAbortedError**, you should close the client socket and end your program when you receive `"Connection success!"` from the server and print the correct password. Make sure that the program isn't stuck in a loop even after printing the correct password.

Note that here and throughout the project, the password is different every time you check your code.

##### Example

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

```terminaloutput
> python hack.py localhost 9090
qWeRTy
```
